            <p>When considering the doctrines of the Stoics, it is important to remember that they think of philosophy not as an interesting pastime or even a particular body of knowledge, but as a way of life. They define philosophy as a kind of practice or exercise (askêsis) in the expertise concerning what is beneficial (Aetius, 26A). Once we come to know what we and the world around us are really like, and especially the nature of value, we will be utterly transformed.</p><br>
            <p>An examination of Stoic ontology might profitably begin with a passage from Plato’s Sophist. There, Plato asks for a mark or indication of what is real or what has being. One answer which is mooted is that the capacity to act or be acted upon is the distinctive mark of real existence or ‘that which is.’ The Stoics accept this criterion and add the rider that only bodies can act or be acted upon. Thus, only bodies exist. So there is a sense in which the Stoics are materialists or – perhaps more accurately, given their understanding of matter as the passive principle – ‘corporealists’. However, they also hold that there are other ways of appearing in the complete inventory of the world than by virtue of existing. Incorporeal things like time, place or sayables are ‘subsistent’ – as are imaginary things like centaurs. The distinction between the subsistent and the existent somewhat complicates the easy assimilation of Stoicism to modern materialism. It’s not wrong to say that all existent things are corporeal according to the Stoics, but one needs to add that existent things don’t exhaust their ontology. All existent things are, in addition, particulars. The Stoics call universals ‘figments of the mind’. Platonic Forms, in particular, are rejected as ‘not somethings’ which lack even the subsistent status of incorporeals like time, place or sayables. The Stoics’ positive nominalist alternative is harder to interpret. Some texts suggest that they offered a conceptualist treatment akin to Locke’s, treating an apparent predication like “man is a rational, mortal animal” as the disguised conditional, “if something is a man, then it is a rational mortal animal”. But there may well have been development within the school from this conceptualist view toward a form of predicate nominalism.</p><br>
            <p>In philosophy of language, their most noted innovation was their theory of ‘sayables’ or lekta. The Stoics distinguish between the signification, the signifier and the name-bearer. Two of these are bodies: the signifier which is the utterance and the name-bearer which is what gets signified. The signification, however, is an incorporeal thing called a lekton, or ‘sayable,’ and it, and neither of the other two, is what is true or false (Sextus Empiricus, 33B). They define a sayable as “that which subsists in accordance with a rational impression.” Rational impressions are those alterations of the commanding faculty or rational mind whose content can be exhibited in language. Presumably ‘graphei Sôkratês’ and ‘Socrates writes’ exhibit the contents of one and the same rational impression in different languages.</p><br>
            <p>The 21st century is seeing yet another revival of virtue ethics in general and of Stoicism in particular. The already mentioned work by philosophers like Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Martha Nussbaum, among others, has brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant Kantian-deontological and utilitarian-consequentialist approaches, so much so that a survey of professional philosophers by David Bourget and David Chalmers (2013) shows that deontology is (barely) the leading endorsed framework (26% of respondents), followed by consequentialism (24%) and not too far behind by virtue ethics (18%), with a scatter of other positions gathering less support. Of course ethics is not a popularity contest, but these numbers indicate the resurgence of virtue ethics in contemporary professional moral philosophy.</p>
