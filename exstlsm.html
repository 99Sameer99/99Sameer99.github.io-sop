        <p>Existentialism is a catch-all term for those philosophers who consider the nature of the human condition as a key philosophical problem and who share the view that this problem is best addressed through ontology.</p><br>

        <h4>According to existentialism:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Existence is always particular and individual—always my existence, your existence, his existence, her existence.</li>
            <li>Existence is primarily the problem of existence (i.e., of its mode of being); it is, therefore, also the investigation of the meaning of Being.</li>
            <li>That investigation is continually faced with diverse possibilities, from among which the existent (i.e., the human individual) must make a selection, to which he must then commit himself.</li>
            <li>Because those possibilities are constituted by the individual’s relationships with things and with other humans, existence is always a being-in-the-world—i.e., in a concrete and historically determinate situation that limits or conditions choice.</li>
        </ol><br>
        
        <p>Humans are therefore called, in Martin Heidegger’s phrase, Dasein (“there being”) because they are defined by the fact that they exist, or are in the world and inhabit it.</p><br>

        <p>Like “rationalism” and “empiricism,” “existentialism” is a term that belongs to intellectual history. Its definition is thus to some extent one of historical convenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by Jean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the postwar literary and philosophical output of Sartre and his associates—notably Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus—existentialism became identified with a cultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s. Among the major philosophers identified as existentialists were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Martin Buber in Germany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the Spaniards José Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the Russians Nikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. The nineteenth century philosophers, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, came to be seen as precursors of the movement. Existentialism was as much a literary phenomenon as a philosophical one.</p><br>

        <p>The fundamental characteristic of existentialist ontology is the primacy that study of the nature of existence gives to the concept of possibility. That priority dominated the philosophy of Kierkegaard and also was amply utilized by Husserl, who had explicitly affirmed the ontological priority of possibility over reality. Possibility, however, is not understood by the existentialists in the purely logical sense as absence of contradiction nor in the traditional metaphysical sense as potentiality destined to become actuality but, rather, in the sense of ontic or objective possibility, which is the very structure of human existence. It is thus the specific modality of the being of humans.</p><br>

        <p>Another way of expressing that thesis is the affirmation of Heidegger and Sartre that “existence precedes essence,” which signifies that humans do not have a nature that determines their modes of being and acting but that, rather, those modes are simply possibilities from which they may choose and on the basis of which they can project themselves. In that sense, Heidegger said that “Dasein is always its own possibility,” and Sartre wrote: “It is true that the possible is—so to speak—an option on being, and if it is true that the possible can come into the world only through a being which is its own possibility, this implies for human reality the necessity of being its being in the form of an option on its being.”</p><br>
